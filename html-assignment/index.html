        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Ravina Rani. I come from India. I was born in Punjab, which is in the northern part of my country. The name of my city is Patran, which comes under the district of Patiala. I admire many things, like reading books that are interesting and provide knowledge, and I also enjoy watching hilarious movies.</p>
        <p>Recently, I completed my senior secondary education with flying colors. Now I live in Canada to pursue my course in Interactive Media Design. The reason behind this decision is that this course offers a lot of subjects like web coding, photography, and creating videos. That's why I decided to enroll in Algonquin College, Ottawa.</p>
